# Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a powerful technique for understanding customer sentiment in product reviews. This project processes Amazon product reviews, using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify them as either positive or negative. This analysis can be valuable for businesses, helping them make data-driven decisions to improve products and customer experiences.

# Project Overview
This project performs the following steps:

- **Data Collection:** Loads Amazon product reviews from a dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes text data, removing noise and preparing it for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Uses techniques such as TF-IDF to convert text into numerical vectors.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Trains a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) to classify reviews as positive or negative.
- **Evaluation:** Measures the modelâ€™s accuracy and fine-tunes it to improve performance.
The analysis is implemented in Python using libraries such as **Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and NLTK.**
